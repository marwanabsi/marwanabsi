## About Me

I’m a data engineer who approaches every problem as a system thinker. I specialize in transforming raw, unstructured information into meaningful, structured, and automated tools that support organizations and teams.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across different sectors — NGOs, startups, and public institutions — delivering real-time dashboards, automated reporting flows, data ingestion systems, and full-stack tools to help decision-makers do more with less.

My focus is always on **building for real impact**. Not just beautiful dashboards or complex code — but systems that remove friction, improve clarity, and help teams scale efficiently.

I believe in using the right tool for the job. Here's what I work with regularly:

- **Languages**: Python, Java, TypeScript, SQL
- **Data Engineering**: Pandas, PySpark, Airflow, Prefect
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Azure SQL, Firebase Realtime DB
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Angular, HTML/CSS, Chart.js
- **Cloud & Infra**: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Synapse, GitHub Actions, Docker
- **BI & Reporting**: Power BI, PDF Export Automation, Data Normalization

## Key Projects

### NGO Auto-Reporting System

**Overview:**  
Developed an end-to-end automated reporting platform for a nonprofit education program where 40+ instructors submitted activity data weekly.

**Problem:**  
Manual reporting using scattered Google Sheets created delays, inconsistency, and data loss.

**Solution:**  
- Integrated Google Sheets API to fetch and consolidate data
- Built a Pandas-based cleaning pipeline (type enforcement, deduplication, normalization)
- Loaded clean records into Azure SQL Database
- Created a public API using Spring Boot to expose data securely
- Developed a responsive Angular dashboard for monitoring metrics and exporting reports
- Automated the entire flow using Prefect with email notifications and retry policies

**Result:**  
Saved over 80 hours/month in manual work and empowered the program managers with real-time insights.

### Government Procurement ETL

**Overview:**  
Built a data pipeline to process procurement records submitted by different departments in inconsistent formats.

**Tech Stack:**  
Python, Azure Blob, Pandas, One-Hot Encoding, Power BI

**Tasks:**
- Read raw Excel files with inconsistent structures
- Applied anomaly detection on quantity and price fields
- Created a model to flag unusual purchases
- Built dashboards in Power BI to visualize procurement trends and cost spikes

**Impact:**  
Helped financial teams spot inconsistencies, track supplier behavior, and report monthly summaries with confidence.

### Inventory Management System

**Overview:**  
Designed a warehouse inventory system with integrated barcode tracking.

**Stack:**  
Angular, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL

**Features:**
- Role-based access for admins and staff
- Real-time stock updates and notifications
- History logging and multi-department tracking
- Clean interface with minimal clicks for daily operations

<!--   ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY      -->
<!-- ============================== -->

## Core Engineering Philosophy

I believe that good data systems should be:

- **Predictable**: You should know exactly what happens when data enters the system.
- **Transparent**: Logic must be clear and traceable from source to output.
- **Automated**: Manual work should be the exception, not the norm.
- **Safe**: Failures should be contained, logged, and recoverable without data loss.
- **Maintainable**: Code should explain itself. Pipelines should be monitored and documented.

That’s how I approach every project, whether it’s a dashboard for a local nonprofit or a backend service for a regional government team.

<!--         DATA THINKING         -->
<!-- ============================== -->

## What I Think About When I Build Data Systems

- **How reliable is the data source?**  
I start by understanding the nature of the inputs — formats, frequency, and quality.

- **What problems can the data actually solve?**  
Data is only useful when it serves decisions, not when it’s just stored.

- **Can the process survive without me?**  
Every automation I build must be documented and handed off properly.

- **What happens when something breaks?**  
Every system needs observability — logs, alerts, fallbacks.

- **How will people interact with this system?**  
From the person collecting the data to the person using the output, I think about experience and clarity.
