## Who I Am

I’m a systems-oriented engineer who turns unstructured data into structured, usable systems that teams actually rely on. My core strength is combining data engineering with full-stack development to create seamless, end-to-end platforms from raw input to live dashboards.

I focus on long-term maintainability, not short-term hacks. Everything I build is meant to scale, survive, and simplify.  

I work with NGOs, startups, and public sector organizations to eliminate repetitive tasks, increase visibility, and drive confident decisions through automation and clear interfaces.

## Featured Projects

### NGO Auto-Reporting Pipeline

**Challenge**  
A growing NGO struggled to gather weekly data from 40+ instructors using inconsistent Google Sheets, resulting in poor visibility and error-prone reporting.

**Solution**  
- Integrated Sheets API to ingest submissions
- Created a Pandas pipeline for cleaning and validation
- Loaded results into Azure SQL DB
- Exposed data via Spring Boot REST APIs
- Developed Angular-based dashboard with real-time filters and PDF exports
- Orchestrated with Prefect for scheduling, retries, and error alerts

**Outcome**  
Monthly reporting time was reduced by 80%, and leadership had real-time access to clean, visualized data.

### Procurement ETL for Government Department

**Highlights**  
- Normalized hundreds of Excel files with messy formats  
- Built anomaly detection logic for flagging suspicious price/quantity entries  
- Visualized via Power BI with breakdowns by supplier, category, and department  
- Created reusable data model and tracking templates  

**Impact**  
Improved financial oversight and enabled cross-departmental tracking with no manual aggregation needed.

### Inventory Management Platform

**Used In:** NGO warehouse tracking & donation management

**Features**
- Barcode scan + update in real-time
- Access roles for different teams
- Stock alerts and reorder indicators
- Transaction logs with timestamps
- Built entirely using Angular + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL

## Core Engineering Values

I design data systems that are:

- **Observable**: I log everything, catch failures, and send alerts before anyone notices issues.
- **Modular**: Pipelines are broken into reusable steps with clear interfaces.
- **Reliable**: From async retries to transaction locks I build for edge cases, not ideal paths.
- **Human-Centered**: Dashboards, APIs, and even logs are made with the user in mind.

I don’t just build “pipelines”, I build environments where data flows clearly, and teams thrive on confidence, not chaos.
